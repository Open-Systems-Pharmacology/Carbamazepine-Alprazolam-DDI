# Carbamazepine-Alprazolam-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Carbamazepine-Alprazolam-DDI studies for model evaluation

Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Carbamazepine-Alprazolam DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. 

The reference model repositories can be found here:

- [Alprazolam OSP PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alprazolam-Model)
- [Carbamazepine PBPK model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Carbamazepine-Model)
